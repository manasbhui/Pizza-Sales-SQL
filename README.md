<h1>Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL</h1>

**Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset by solving SQL queries to extract key business insights. The analysis ranges from basic metrics, such as total orders and revenue, to advanced insights like revenue contributions and category-wise sales performance. By leveraging SQL, I was able to explore ordering patterns, identify top-selling pizzas, and analyze sales distribution over time.

**Key Objectives**

The primary aim of this project was to answer critical business questions related to pizza sales and provide data-driven insights for decision-making. These include:

<h3>Basic Queries:</h3>

**1. Total Orders:** Retrieve the total number of pizza orders placed.

**2. Revenue Calculation:** Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

**3. Highest-Priced Pizza:** Identify the most expensive pizza in the menu.

**4. Popular Pizza Size:** Identify the most common pizza size ordered by customers.

**5. Top Pizza Types:** List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

<h3>Intermediate Queries:</h3>

**1. Category-Wise Sales:** Join tables to find the total quantity of pizzas ordered in each category.

**2. Hourly Sales Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of pizza orders by hour of the day.

**3. Category-Wise Distribution:** Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

**4. Daily Sales Average:** Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

**5. Top Pizza Types by Revenue:** Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

<h3>Advanced Queries:</h3>

**1. Revenue Contribution:** Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

**2. Cumulative Revenue:** Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

**3. Category-Wise Top Pizza Types:** Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

<h3>Approach</h3>

I used structured SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the pizza sales dataset. The process involved:

**1. Data Exploration:** Examined the dataset to understand its structure and relevant fields for the analysis.

**2. Query Execution:** Solved the given business questions by writing efficient SQL queries.

**3. Data Insights:** Interpreted the query results to draw meaningful conclusions, such as identifying top-performing pizza categories, peak ordering hours, and revenue contributions of specific pizza types.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting business insights from sales data. The queries provided valuable information about pizza sales performance, helping understand customer preferences, peak times, and revenue distribution across different pizza categories. These insights can aid in better decision-making for pricing, inventory management, and promotional strategies.
